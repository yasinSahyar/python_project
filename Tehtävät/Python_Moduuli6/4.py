"""
Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter. The function returns the sum of all the numbers 
in the list. For testing, write a main program where you create a list, call the function, and print out the value it returned.
"""

"""
2.The sum_list function takes a single argument, numbers, which is a list of integers that we want to sum up. The function uses 
the built-in sum function to add up all the numbers in the list, and then returns this value.
5.The main program creates a list of numbers called numbers and then calls the sum_list function with this list as an argument.
 It stores the result of the function call in a variable called total.
