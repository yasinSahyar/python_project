"""
Write a function that gets the quantity of gasoline in American gallons and returns the number converted to litres.
Write a main program that asks for a volume in gallons from the user and converts the value to liters.
The conversion must be done by using the function. Conversions continue until the user inputs a negative value.

"""
2.function takes a single argument, gallons, which is the quantity of gasoline in American gallons that we want to convert to litres
10.Inside the loop, the program reads the userâ€™s input as a float and stores it in the gallons variable
